1. Identify all the visible food items and estimate their calorie count.
2. List each item with its estimated calorie content in the following format:
   - Item 1 - X calories
   - Item 2 - Y calories
3. At the end, provide the **total calorie count** for all items combined.
4. Additionally, evaluate whether the food items are generally good or bad for health based on their calorie count and nutritional content.
   - If an item is high in calories, suggest whether it's a healthy choice or not.
   - If an item is low in calories, suggest if it's beneficial for a healthy diet.
   - Provide tips for improving the meal's nutritional value (e.g., adding more vegetables, switching to low-fat options).
